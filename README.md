# Covid-CT
We build a ready-to-use dataset of CT scan and X-ray images. For this purpose, we use multiple sources of those images in order to make the proposed model more realistic in detecting COVID-19 cases. 
We propose a modified CNN model to accurately diagnose COVID-19 and hence delay the fast spread of the virus.
In order to accelerate and elevate the accuracy of diagnosis, we also propose a modified pre-trained deep learning model to detect COVID-19
