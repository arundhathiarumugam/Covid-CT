# Covid-CT
* We build a ready-to-use dataset of CT scan and X-ray images. For this purpose, we use multiple sources of those images in order to make the proposed model more realistic in detecting COVID-19 cases. 
We propose a modified CNN model to accurately diagnose COVID-19 and hence delay the fast spread of the virus.
In order to accelerate and elevate the accuracy of diagnosis, we also propose a modified pre-trained deep learning model to detect COVID-19


* To address this problem, we adopt two approaches: transfer learning and data augmentation. Transfer learning aims to leverage a large collection of data from a relevant domain to help with the learning in the interested domain. Specically, we use a large
collection of chest X-ray images to pre-train a deep convolutional neural network, then fine-tune this pre-trained network on the COVID-CT dataset.
